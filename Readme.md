Here's a summary of my accomplishments and learnings from each HackTheBox module:

<h1> Introduction to Active Directory: <h1>

Accomplishment: Successfully completed the Introduction to Active Directory module on HackTheBox.
Learning: Gained a comprehensive understanding of Active Directory fundamentals, including domain controllers, users, groups, and organizational units (OUs). Learned how to perform basic enumeration and reconnaissance techniques within an Active Directory environment. Explored common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in Active Directory deployments.

<h1> Intro to Network Traffic Analysis: <h1>

Accomplishment: Completed the Intro to Network Traffic Analysis module on HackTheBox.
Learning: Developed skills in analyzing network traffic to identify anomalies, suspicious activities, and potential security threats. Learned how to use Wireshark and other network analysis tools to capture, filter, and analyze network packets. Explored different protocols and their behaviors, including TCP, UDP, ICMP, and HTTP. Gained insights into detecting and mitigating network-based attacks such as port scanning, sniffing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

<h1> Incident Handling Process: <h1>

Accomplishment: Successfully completed the Incident Handling Process module on HackTheBox.
Learning: Acquired knowledge and practical experience in handling cybersecurity incidents effectively. Learned about the incident response lifecycle, including preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Explored incident classification, prioritization, and escalation procedures. Developed skills in analyzing and documenting security incidents, coordinating response efforts, and communicating with stakeholders.

<h1> Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil: <h1>

Accomplishment: Completed the Windows Event Logs & Finding Evil module on HackTheBox.
Learning: Deepened understanding of Windows event logging mechanisms and how they can be leveraged for security monitoring and analysis. Learned how to interpret and correlate event log entries to identify malicious activities, suspicious patterns, and indicators of compromise (IOCs). Explored various event log sources, including Security, System, Application, and PowerShell logs. Developed skills in using event log analysis tools and techniques to detect and investigate security incidents on Windows systems.

Overall, through these HackTheBox modules, I have gained valuable hands-on experience and knowledge in critical areas of cybersecurity, including Active Directory security, network traffic analysis, incident handling, and Windows event log analysis. These skills are essential for identifying and responding to security threats effectively, enhancing my capabilities as a cybersecurity professional.
